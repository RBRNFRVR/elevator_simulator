Elevator Simulator

Assumptions:
I assumed we will not have to deal with numerous floors so I added the reasonable limit of 15, though can be changed with just updating the highest floor variable on top.
I also assumed that this is realistic elevator so weight needs to be taken into account so a maximum limit of 5 passengers is reasonable.

Missing features:
Not picking up passengers that could be waiting on other floors to enter elevator.
Not dropping off passengers who floors were passed on the way going down to lower floors, instead they must wait for the their order to come but I have been in elevators that have done that.

Thank your for the opportunity to this, it was fun.
